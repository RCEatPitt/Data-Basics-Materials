    "# Navigating Files and Directories\n",
    "\n",
    "The part of the operating system responsible for managing files and directories \n",
    "is called the **file system**.\n",
    "It organizes our data into files,\n",
    "which hold information,\n",
    "and directories (also called \"folders\"),\n",
    "which hold files or other directories.\n",
    "\n",
    "Several commands are frequently used to create, inspect, rename, and delete files and directories.\n",
    "To start exploring them, we'll go to our open shell window.\n",
    "\n",
    "First let's find out where we are by running a command called `pwd`\n",
    "(which stands for \"print working directory\"). Directories are like *places* - at any time\n",
    "while we are using the shell we are in exactly one place, called\n",
    "our **current working directory**. Commands mostly read and write files in the \n",
    "current working directory, i.e. \"here\", so knowing where you are before running\n",
    "a command is important. `pwd` shows you where you are:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "[mcburton@jupyterhub ~]$ pwd\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "/ihome/mburton/mcburton\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here,\n",
    "the computer's response is `/ihome/mburton/mcburton`,\n",
    "which is mcburton's **home directory**.\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand what a “home directory” is, let’s have a look at how the file system as a whole is organized. For the sake of this example, we’ll be illustrating the filesystem on our scientist Nelle’s computer. After this illustration, you’ll be learning commands to explore your own filesystem, which will be constructed in a similar way, but not be exactly identical.\n",
    "\n",
    "On Nelle’s fictional computer, the filesystem looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Nelle's home directory](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/fig/filesystem.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "At the top is the **root directory**\n",
    "that holds everything else.\n",
    "We refer to it using a slash character, `/`, on its own;\n",
    "this is the leading slash in `/Users/nelle`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inside that directory are several other directories:\n",
    "`bin` (which is where some built-in programs are stored),\n",
    "`data` (for miscellaneous data files),\n",
    "`Users` (where users' personal directories are located),\n",
    "`tmp` (for temporary files that don't need to be stored long-term),\n",
    "and so on.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We know that our current working directory `/Users/nelle` is stored inside `/Users`\n",
    "because `/Users` is the first part of its name.\n",
    "Similarly,\n",
    "we know that `/Users` is stored inside the root directory `/`\n",
    "because its name begins with `/`.\n",
    "\n",
    "> ### Slashes\n",
    "> \n",
    "> Notice that there are two meanings for the / character. When it appears at the front of a file or directory name, it refers to the root directory. When it appears inside a name, it’s just a separator.\n",
    "\n",
    "Underneath `/Users`,\n",
    "we find one directory for each user with an account on Nelle's machine,\n",
    "her colleagues the Mummy and Wolfman.  \n",
    "\n",
    "![Home Directories](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/fig/home-directories.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "The Mummy's files are stored in `/Users/imhotep`,\n",
    "Wolfman's in `/Users/larry`,\n",
    "and Nelle's in `/Users/nelle`.  Because Nelle is the user in our\n",
    "examples here, this is why we get `/Users/nelle` as our home directory.  \n",
    "Typically, when you open a new command prompt you will be in\n",
    "your home directory to start.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's learn the command that will let us see the contents of our\n",

    "\n",
    "Knowing just this much about files and directories,\n",
    "Nelle is ready to organize the files that the protein assay machine will create.\n",
    "First,\n",
    "she creates a directory called `north-pacific-gyre`\n",
    "(to remind herself where the data came from).\n",
    "Inside that,\n",
    "she creates a directory called `2012-07-03`,\n",
    "which is the date she started processing the samples.\n",
    "She used to use names like `conference-paper` and `revised-results`,\n",
    "but she found them hard to understand after a couple of years.\n",
    "(The final straw was when she found herself creating\n",
    "a directory called `revised-revised-results-3`.)\n",
    "\n",
    "> ## Sorting Output\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Nelle names her directories \"year-month-day\",\n",
    "> with leading zeroes for months and days,\n",
    "> because the shell displays file and directory names in alphabetical order.\n",
    "> If she used month names,\n",
    "> December would come before July;\n",
    "> if she didn't use leading zeroes,\n",
    "> November ('11') would come before July ('7'). Similarly, putting the year first\n",
    "> means that June 2012 will come before June 2013.\n",
    "{: .callout}\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of her physical samples is labelled according to her lab's convention\n",
    "with a unique ten-character ID,\n",
    "such as \"NENE01729A\".\n",
    "This is what she used in her collection log\n",
    "to record the location, time, depth, and other characteristics of the sample,\n",
    "so she decides to use it as part of each data file's name.\n",
    "Since the assay machine's output is plain text,\n",
    "she will call her files `NENE01729A.txt`, `NENE01812A.txt`, and so on.\n",
    "All 1520 files will go into the same directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now in her current directory `data-shell`,\n",
    "Nelle can see what files she has using the command:\n",
    "\n",
    "~~~\n",
    "$ ls north-pacific-gyre/2012-07-03/\n",
    "~~~\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a lot to type,\n",
    "but she can let the shell do most of the work through what is called **tab completion**.\n",

    "\n",
    "~~~\n",
    "$ ls nor\n",
    "~~~\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "and then presses tab (the tab key on her keyboard),\n",

    "\n",
    "~~~\n",
    "$ ls north-pacific-gyre/\n",
    "~~~\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If she presses tab again,\n",
    "Bash will add `2012-07-03/` to the command,\n",
    "since it's the only possible completion.\n",
    "Pressing tab again does nothing,\n",
    "since there are 19 possibilities;\n",
    "pressing tab twice brings up a list of all the files,\n",
    "and so on.`\n",
    "This is called **tab completion**,\n",
    "and we will see it in many other tools as we go on."

    "- The file system is responsible for managing information on the disk.\n",

    "- `/` on its own is the root directory of the whole file system.\n",
    "- A relative path specifies a location starting from the current location.\n",
    "- An absolute path specifies a location from the root of the file system.\n",
    "- Directory names in a path are separated with `/` on Unix, but `\\\\` on Windows.\"\n",
    "- `..` means 'the directory above the current one'; `.` on its own means 'the current directory'.\n",
    "- Most files' names are `something.extension`. The extension isn't required, and doesn't guarantee anything, but is normally used to indicate the type of data in the file."
