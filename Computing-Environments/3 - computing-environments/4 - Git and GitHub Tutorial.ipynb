    "## What is GitHub?\n",
    "---\n",
    "GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial teaches you GitHub essentials like repositories, branches, commits, and Pull Requests. You’ll create your own Hello World repository and learn GitHub’s Pull Request workflow, a popular way to create and review code.\n",
    "\n",
    "** You'll learn how to:**\n",
    "* Create and use a repository\n",
    "* Start and manage a new branch\n",
    "* make changes to a file and push them to GitHub as commits\n",
    "* Open and merge a pull request\n",
    "\n",
    "## Joining GitHub\n",
    "---\n",
    "To use GitHub you can first register through the following link: https://github.com/join\n",
    "\n",
    "While GitHub has a web interface and a graphical user interface that you can install to your computer, you may find it easiest to use Git commands directly with your local terminal to publish to your repositories. You can install Git on your machine with the following links:\n",
    "* For Windows: https://git-for-windows.github.io/\n",
    "* For MacOS: https://code.google.com/archive/p/git-osx-installer/downloads\n",
    "* For Linux: https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 1. Create and Checkout a Repository\n",
    "---\n",
    "A **repository** is usually used to organize a single project. Repositories can contain folders and files, images, videos, spreadsheets, and data sets – anything your project needs. We recommend including a *README*, or a file with information about your project. GitHub makes it easy to add one at the same time you create your new repository. It also offers other common options such as a *license file*.\n",
    "\n",
    "### To create a new repository\n",
    "1. In the upper right corner, next to your avatar or identicon, click + and then select **New repository**.\n",
    "2. Name your repository **hello-world**.\n",
    "3. Write a short description.\n",
    "4. Select **Initialize this repository with a README**.\n",
    "5. Click **Create repository**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### To checkout a repository\n",
    "Create a working copy of a local repository by running the command **git clone /path/to/repository**. When using github, your command will be **git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY** If you go to your repository page, click the green **Clone or Download** button near the top right corner, and click the copy to clipboard button (the clipboard icon), you can paste the path directly into your terminal. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 2. Create a Branch\n",
    "---\n",
    "**Branching** is the way to work on different versions of a repository at one time.\n",
    "\n",
    "By default your repository has one branch named **master** which is considered to be the definitive branch. We use branches to experiment and make edits before committing them to **master**.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you create a branch off the **master** branch, you’re making a copy, or snapshot, of **master** as it was at that point in time. If someone else made changes to the **master** branch while you were working on your branch, you could pull in those updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Have you ever saved different versions of a file? Something like:\n",
    "\n",
    "* story.txt\n",
    "* story-john-edit.txt\n",
    "* story-john-edit-reviewed.txt\n",
    "\n",
    "Branches accomplish similar goals in GitHub repositories.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the world of development, developers, writers, and designers use branches for keeping bug fixes and feature work separate from **master** (production) branch. When a change is ready, they merge their branch into **master**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### To create a new branch\n",
    "1. Go to your new repository **hello-world**.\n",
    "2. Type **git checkout -b readme-edits** to create a new branch for edits.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you have two branches, **master** and **readme-edits**. They look exactly the same, but not for long! Next we’ll add our changes to the new branch.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 3. Make and Commit Changes\n",
    "---\n",
    "Bravo! Now, you’re on the code view for your **readme-edits** branch, which is a copy of **master**. Let’s make some edits.\n",
    "\n",
    "On GitHub, saved changes are called *commits*. Each commit has an associated *commit message*, which is a description explaining why a particular change was made. Commit messages capture the history of your changes, so other contributors can understand what you’ve done and why.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Make and commit changes\n",
    "You can propose changes (add them to the index) using **git add filename**, then using **git add ***. To actually commit these changes, use **git commit -m 'commit message'** This commits the file to the HEAD, but not in your remote repository yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "Try opening up your README and make a few edits. Use the instructions above to commit your changes. These changes will be made to just the README file on your **readme-edits** branch, so now this branch contains content that’s different from **master**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 4. Pushing Changes\n",
    "---\n",
    "Nice edits! Now that you have changes in a branch off of **master**, you can open a *pull request*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pull Requests are the heart of collaboration on GitHub. When you open a pull request, you’re proposing your changes and requesting that someone review and pull in your contribution and merge them into their branch. Pull requests show *diffs*, or differences, of the content from both branches. The changes, additions, and subtractions are shown in green and red.\n",
    "\n",
    "As soon as you make a commit, you can open a pull request and start a discussion, even before the code is finished.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can even open pull requests in your own repository and merge them yourself. It’s a great way to learn the GitHub flow before working on larger projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "### To open a pull request\n",
    "\n",
    "In your terminal on your branch, simply type **git push origin 'branch name'**, or in this case, **git push origin readme-edits**. Once you do this, you'll notice that new changes have appeared in your web browser. When you're satisfied that these are the changes that you want to submit, click the green **New Pull Request** button. Now you can view all of the edits that you have committed. Look over your changes in the diffs on the Compare page, make sure they’re what you want to submit. When you’re satisfied that these are the changes you want to submit, click the big green **Create Pull Request** button. Give your pull request a title and write a brief description of your changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### To merge your pull request\n",
    "In this final step, it's time to bring your changes together - merging your **readme-edits** branch into **master**\n",
    "1. Click the green **Merge pull request** button to merge the changes into master.\n",
    "2. Click **Confirm merge**.\n",
    "3. Go ahead and delete the branch since its changes have been incorporated.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Congratulations!\n",
    "You now know the basics of using GitHub! There is still a lot out there to learn to unlock the full power of version control.
