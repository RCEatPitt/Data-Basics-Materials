    "You're definitely going to get stuck at some point doing this assignment. When you do, there's a methodology that I think is helpful that you should try to develop. It comes from FreeCodeCamp (incidentally, a great resource for teaching yourself some coding), and it's called [Read-Search-Ask](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/read-search-dont-be-afraid-to-ask-743a23c411b4).\n",
    "\n",
    "These three steps will get you through these assignments, and the habit will help you throughout your life coding. They're basically as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. *Read.* Reread the error messages you get, reread the exercise description, read the relevant parts from the textbook, read over any code that might be given to you, read over any supplementary materials you might've gotten that relate to what you're doing. Try any solutions or potential changes that come to mind after reading or were suggested while you're reading. You can do that as many times as you want; it doesn't hurt anybody to try putting in another parenthesis and hit Shift-Enter again.\n",
    "2. *Search.* By now, you probably have a pretty good idea of what your problem is. Google it! Look on StackExchange, coding forums, and other websites. Don't copy and paste code (you know what plagiarism is) but try to see what others did that's different from what you have.\n",
    "3. *Ask.* If you're still in lab and you're stuck, raise your hand! If not, us an email. Come to our office hours. We'll help you out.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Read-Search-Ask is going to be helpful; keep it in the back of your mind as you're doing these assignments."
