    "You're going to improve this program, using what you learned in chapters 4 and 5. You're going to make three major changes:\n",

    "1. Rewrite the program **using a function** called `computegrade()`. Define that function so that it takes the score (between 0 and 100) as an **argument** and returns the grade as a string.   \n",
    "    You can do the return one of two ways: either the function `computegrade()` can print out the letter grade, or by using a return statement: for example, `return \"A\"`. If you use a return statement, you're going to have to print it out in the main block of your program. That'll look something like this: `print(\"Grade:\", computegrade(score))`  \n",
    "    Using return statements is theoretically the \"better\" way to do this problem, but it is quite a bit more difficult, so consider that a challenge if you want to do it that way. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Using `try` and `except`, **allow the user** to enter either an int *or* a float for the score. If you've already done that in last week's assignment, congratulations, you're awesome! Pat yourself on the back.  \n",
    "![pat yourself on the back](https://media.giphy.com/media/3oFzmbl7X4uIyj2wrm/giphy.gif)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Here's the real hard part: you're going to let the user enter as many grades as they want. You're going to want to put the code that asks the user for a grade in an *infinite while loop* so it executes as many times as the user wants.   \n",
    "    If the user enters a number less than 0 or greater than 100, use a `break` statement to quit the loop and exit the program. This means that you're going to want to test whether or not the score entered is between 0 and 100 *before* you call `computegrade(score)`.\n",
    "    \n",
    "This is a tough problem, so take it step by step. Work on the first improvement, and only move to the second once you're completely finished with the first. **Test your program** thoroughly after each step, to make sure you haven't inadvertently changed something you didn't want to. If you get stuck on this problem, skip to the next one and come back to it later. If you're still stuck, come to office hours or shoot me an email."
