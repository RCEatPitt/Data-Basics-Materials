# Links to More Resources

While you are at Pitt you have access to two excellent resources:
* https://learning.oreilly.com/home/ - This is an extremely comprehensive online digital library of technology books. Also has a great mobile app!
* https://www.linkedin.com/learning - Formally Lynda.com, this is a huge library of videos and tutorials about technology topics.

Here are some resources from both of those digital libraries and the open web related to the topics from Data Basics.

## Python
* [Python For Everybody](https://www.py4e.com/book) is a great book oriented towards doing stuff with data.
* [Whirlwind Tour of Python](https://www.oreilly.com/programming/free/files/a-whirlwind-tour-of-python.pdf) and [GitHub repository with notebooks](https://github.com/jakevdp/WhirlwindTourOfPython/blob/master/README.md) is a great resource for folks who know how to program in other languages or need a quick Python refresher.
